# Search for a Verify Request

You can use the search functionality to see the current status or eventual outcome of a Verify request, using the `request_id` returned when the verify code was sent.

Replace the following variables in the sample code with your own values:

```snippet_variables
- VONAGE_API_KEY
- VONAGE_API_SECRET
- REQUEST_ID.VERIFY
```

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/verify/search-verification-request'
```
