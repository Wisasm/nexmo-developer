# Get an Event

In this code snippet you learn how to get an Event.

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

```snippet_variables
- CONVERSATION_ID
- EVENT_ID
```

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/conversation/event/get-event'
application:
  use_existing: |
    You will need to use an existing Application that contains a Conversation in order to be able to create an Event and then retrieve details for one. See the Create Conversation code snippet for information on how to create an Application and some sample Conversations.
```

## Try it out

When you run the code you will get the specified Event.
