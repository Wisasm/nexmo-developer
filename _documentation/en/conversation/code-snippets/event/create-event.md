# Create an Event

In this code snippet you learn how to create an Event.

## Example

Ensure the following variables are set to your required values using any convenient method:

```snippet_variables
- CONVERSATION_ID
- MEMBER_ID
```

```code_snippets
source: '_examples/conversation/event/create-event'
application:
  use_existing: |
    You will need to use an existing Application that contains a Conversation in order to be able to create an Event. See the Create Conversation code snippet for information on how to create an Application and some sample Conversations.
```

## Try it out

When you run the code you will create a new Event.
